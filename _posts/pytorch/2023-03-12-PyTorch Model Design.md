## 1. General Steps for PyTorch Model Design

`PyTorch` provides a comprehensive framework for designing and training neural network models. The general process of model design typically involves the following steps:

Further refinement is shown below ⬇️

- **1. Define the Model Architecture**: Start by specifying the architecture of the neural network, which usually includes:
  - Input and output sizes
  - Number of layers
  - Number of neurons per layer
  - Activation functions
  - ...

- **2. Define the Loss Function**: The loss function evaluates the model's performance during training and guides the optimizer to update model parameters. `PyTorch` offers various built-in loss functions, such as:
  - Cross-entropy loss
  - Mean squared error
  - ...

- **3. Define the Optimizer**: Optimizers update the model's parameters to minimize the loss function. Common optimizers in `PyTorch` include:
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Adam
  - ...

- **4. Train the Model**: Once the model, loss function, and optimizer are defined, training can begin. Each epoch typically involves feeding input data, computing the loss, calculating gradients, and updating the model parameters.

- **5. Evaluate the Model**: During training, it is essential to periodically test the model on new data to assess its performance. Unlike training, the evaluation process does not update the model parameters.

- **6. Save and Load the Model**: After training, you can save the model for future use. `PyTorch` provides methods for saving and loading models, such as:
    - `torch.save()`
    - `torch.load()`

## 2. Defining a Neural Network Model

To define a neural network model, it's crucial to understand the core building blocks — **neural network layers**. Let’s dive in 💐🍃!

### 2.1 Neural Network Models vs. Neural Network Layers

A **neural network layer** is a fundamental building block of a neural network model. It is a set of neurons organized to perform specific tasks within the network. 

Each layer can be viewed as a function mapping input data (often a tensor) to output data.

A **neural network model** is composed of multiple layers working together to achieve a specific task, as shown below ⬇️:

Neural network layers often include learnable parameters (e.g., weights and biases), which are automatically updated during training through **backpropagation**.

### 2.2 Common Neural Network Layers

Some common neural network layers include:

- **Fully Connected Layer (FC)**: This basic layer performs a linear transformation from input to output. Fully connected layers often use activation functions like `Sigmoid` or `ReLU` to introduce non-linearity.

- **Convolutional Layer (Conv)**: Used primarily for image and multidimensional data, convolutional layers employ filters (kernels) to extract features. Each kernel corresponds to one output channel.

- **Pooling Layer**: Pooling layers reduce the size of feature maps and the number of parameters in a network. Popular methods include `MaxPooling` and `AveragePooling`. These layers typically do not use activation functions.

In practice, many other types of layers can be incorporated depending on the task and dataset.

### 2.3 Common Neural Network Models

Neural network models combine various layers and operations to tackle specific tasks. Below are a few examples ⬇️:

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Suited for **image processing tasks**, CNNs use convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, followed by fully connected layers for classification or regression.
<p></p>

- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Designed for sequential data, RNNs utilize recurrent units (e.g., LSTM, GRU) to process input sequences. RNNs are widely used in **natural language processing** and **speech recognition**.
<p></p>

- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: DNNs consist of multiple hidden layers and are widely applied in **image classification**, **NLP**, and **recommendation systems**.
<p></p>

- **Autoencoder**: A model for unsupervised learning, autoencoders are used for **feature extraction** and **data dimensionality reduction**, finding applications in **image denoising** and **data compression**.
<p></p>

- **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, trained adversarially to generate realistic data.

#### 2.3.1 CNN Structure Diagram

A typical **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** consists of layers organized as follows ⬇️:

> **[Input] -> [Conv2D] -> [Activation] -> [MaxPooling] -> [Conv2D] -> [Activation] -> [MaxPooling] -> [Flatten] -> [Dense] -> [Activation] -> [Dense] -> [Activation] -> [Output]**

<img src="/assets/imgs/ai/PyTorch/model-design/CNN-struct.jpeg" width="600" />

Key components:
- **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data.
- **Convolutional Layer (Conv2D)**: Performs convolution to extract features using filters.
- **Activation Layer**: Adds non-linear transformations, e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid.
- **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the size of feature maps to prevent overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layer (Dense)**: Maps features to the output space.
- **Output Layer**: Outputs the final result, often used for classification or regression.

## 3. PyTorch Code Implementation

In `PyTorch`, neural network layers are typically implemented by subclassing the **nn.Module** class.

> The **nn.Module** class organizes neural network models, tracks parameters, and provides utilities for training and testing. It includes pre-built layers like **nn.Linear**, **nn.Conv2d**, **nn.MaxPool2d**, and activation functions like **nn.ReLU**.

Here’s a simple example of a neural network:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out

```

In this example:
- **`__init__`** defines the model's layers (two linear layers and a ReLU activation).
- **`forward`** specifies the forward propagation logic: passing input through layers and activations to produce output.

Using **nn.Module** simplifies training by automatically tracking parameters and gradients. Coupled with PyTorch’s optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam) and loss functions (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss), it enables seamless model training.
